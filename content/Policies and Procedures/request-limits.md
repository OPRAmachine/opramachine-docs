By default, users of OPRAmachine are limited to 6 requests per day. This list is in place to ensure that users do not abuse OPRAmachine or send vexatious requests to public authorities.

We recognize that some users may need to make more than this amount of requests per day. Therefore, if you contact us and provide justification as to why you would like us to lift the limit, we will consider increasing the amount of requests you are allowed to send per day at our discretion. We will be more likely to grant your request if your account has a history of making high-quality past requests.
