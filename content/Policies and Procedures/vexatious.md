Requests that are filed solely to harass governmental agencies (vexatious requests) are strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated on the OPRAmachine service. The OPRAmachine site administration does not condone the contents of any OPRA request.

The OPRAmachine site administration reserves the sole right to determine whether or not a request was vexatious, and we may wait to take action against a vexatious requester until the requester was provided an opportunity to be heard and / or an opportunity to correct or abate the vexatious requests.
