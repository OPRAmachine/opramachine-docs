Motion papers are filed during the case and can take a variety of forms. The common thread of all motion papers is that they are requesting that the court do something, such as compel depositions, or a motion requesting that a lawsuit be dismissed.

Requesting motion documents can be useful if you are attempting to follow a case as it is making its way through the system, typically during the pretrial phase of the case.
