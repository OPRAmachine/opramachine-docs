Vendor history reports are printed reports generated from the procurement software utilized by government agencies. The reports show all of the amounts and payments of money remitted to vendors and contractors paid with taxpayer money. They can be useful for documenting how much money has been paid to professional services vendors retained by governments at the state and local level.
