Yes, OPRA requests themselves are public records and may be readily obtained using OPRAmachine. We have found that municipalities and counties have varied fairly wildly with the extent to which they redact personally identifying information from the request forms and emails sent requesting public records under OPRA.

Some government agencies have imposed "special service" charges to requests that are seeking a high volume of records, such as OPRAs covering several months. As emphasized in past documentation pages, breaking a request into smaller requests for narrower periods of time is a good way to avoid being charged a fee for the records you are seeking.
