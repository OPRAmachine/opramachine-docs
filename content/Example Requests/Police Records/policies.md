 The policies and procedures that govern local and county police departments should be easily obtainable using OPRAmachine. As some of the example requests will show, it may be advisable to break your request into narrower requests to obtain specific policies in order to avoid dealing with special service charges levied by the departments due to the voluminous nature of the OPRA request.

## Example requests
The following are example requests made for this type of record on OPRAmachine:
