Almost every police department currently makes use of a Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system. CAD allows police departments to effectively store data about calls for service and the status of officers in the field. It allows law enforcement officers to quickly obtain the information that they need to accomplish their jobs, as well as assisting dispatchers with the logistics of their operations.

Requesting CAD reports can allow you to get an idea of the types of police, fire & EMS calls for service at a given address for a period of time.
