Meeting minutes and agendas are among the most routinely requested records that are made available to the public under OPRA.

## Executive session meeting minutes

Executive session meetings exclude members of the public and allow members of governing bodies to receive confidential / attorney-client privileged / personnel and other information legally protected from disclosure.

Minutes taken at executive sessions can be kept confidential, however previous executive session meeting minutes may be released under OPRA when the need for confidentiality is no longer present.
