You can use RSS feeds to obtain data on requests and responses sent via the OPRAmachine platform. On most URLs of the site, you can simply preface links with /feed/ in order to obtain an RSS feed for a particular public body, user or request.

Local news websites have incorporated the RSS feeds by allowing their readers to view requests for a given government, such as a county or municipal government. You can use the RSS feeds to keep track of your town.
