We offer an API for developers to integrate their applications with OPRAmachine and our extensive archive of public records.

The API currently offers read-only access to feeds of data and has both JSON and RSS endpoints. Data feeds are available for users, public agencies, and the site as a whole.

[Example implementation of our API on a personal website](https://github.com/gavinrozzi/alaveteli-hugo-shortcodes)

[JSON data feed - all successful OPRA requests](https://opramachine.com/feed/search/%20(latest_status:successful%20OR%20latest_status:partially_successful).json)

[JSON data feed - all OPRA requests & responses](https://opramachine.com/feed/search/%20(variety:sent%20OR%20variety:followup_sent%20OR%20variety:response%20OR%20variety:comment).json)
