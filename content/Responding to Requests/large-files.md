Sometimes the response to request will require a large amount of space, such as when videos are requested. There are several ways that custodians canDeal with largeFiles when responding to requests through the OPRAmachine website.

## File Size Limits

Each new OPRA request submitted through OPRAmachine results in the generation of a unique @requests.opramachine.com email address. The requests.opramachine.com mail ServerIs currently configured to accept emailAttachmentsUp to 100 MBIn size. Please note that this limit only applies to our server, and your email provider may have smaller quotas for attachment, so caveat emptor.

### Consider breaking up the response into multiple email attachments
If you need to send documents that are in excess of 100 MB (or whatever your email provider's attachment file size limit is) in response to a request, one option of doing so is to break up your response up into multiple emails, and send part of the response in each email message.

## Google Drive and Dropbox
Another option to consider for sharing large volumes of files that cannot be delivered via email attachments are cloud based solutions such as Google Drive and Dropbox. These may be appropriate for material such as police dashboard camera footage or large amount of data in other formats.
