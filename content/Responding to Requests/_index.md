## Records custodians only
{{% notice info %}}Please note that this section of the documentation is written for the usage of records custodians to make it easier for them to respond to requests. It is not intended for this section to be read by requesters, however it may provide some insight into the site's process.{{% /notice %}}

### Multiple ways to respond

Responding to OPRA requests made via OPRAmachine is easy and designed for both the convenience of the requester and the custodian of records. This section of the documentation will fully explain the process of responding to a request and the multiple options available to government agencies to comply with OPRA requests submitted through our interactive web portal.

No matter how you choose to respond, the requester will be immediately notified by our system when you respond, and your response to each OPRA request will be made public in our searchable database of requests and public documents.
