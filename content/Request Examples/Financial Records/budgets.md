The Municipal Budget is perhaps the most requested municipal record, as it is passed every year and influences the size and scale of municipal government for the upcoming calendar, and for residents, that size and scale comes in the form of property taxes.

You can request copies of municipal budgets using OPRAmachine. Note that these budgets are commonly available on other internet websites.
