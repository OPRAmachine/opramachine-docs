You can obtain legal documents that are served on, or filed on behalf of government agencies in state or federal court. Obtaining legal documents under OPRA is often more convenient and cheaper, as it allows you to avoid having to make your request to courts outside of OPRA where you will likely be charged fees and face longer wait times.
