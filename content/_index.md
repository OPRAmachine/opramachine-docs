## Welcome
The **OPRAmachine Documentation** [docs.opramachine.com](https://docs.opramachine.com/) is your destination for information on how the [OPRAmachine](https://opramachine.com/) website works, how the website's administration decisions are made, as well as guides on how to make requests for specific types of public records under the New Jersey Open Public Records Act using OPRAmachine.

Beginning in 2018, this documentation website will supersede [the existing help material](https://opramachine.com/help/about) that is currently hosted at the existing OPRAmachine website. This documentation website will allow us to more effectively meet the needs of our users and the community at large. During the transitional period between the two documentation websites, both systems will remain operational in order to ensure that all users are able to effectively obtain information.

One of the reasons we have chose to migrate to this platform for is the fact that this documentation is
hosted on a separate server and content delivery network from the main OPRAmachine application and it will
not be impacted by server outages or maintenance issues.

## Help improve our documentation
We hope that this documentation will help answer some of the most common questions that we have received from requesters and records custodians. The OPRAmachine administration also aims to communicate site technical issues and outages both on this platform and on the OPRAmachine blog (blog.opramachine.com).
While we aim for this documentation to be as complete as possible, there may be some things we are missing.

Feel free to update the content of this site's pages, just click the **Edit this page** link displayed on top right of each page, and submit a pull request with your changes. Your changes will be deployed automatically when merged after review.

## Your feedback
Please reach out to the documentation's editor,[Gavin Rozzi](https://www.gavinrozzi.com) with any feedback about this documentation. Feedback may also be submitted to any other member of the OPRAmachine team for their consideration. Issues may be submitted via [Github](https://github.com/gavinrozzi/opramachine-docs/issues) to this or any of our website repositories.
