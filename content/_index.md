## Welcome
The OPRAmachine Documentation (docs.opramachine.com) is your destination for information on how the site works, how administration decisions are made, as well as guides on how to make requests for specific types of public records under the New Jersey Open Public Records Act using the OPRAmachine web interface.

Beginning in 2018, this documentation website will supersede the existing help material that is currently hosted at the existing OPRAmachine website, as this documentation platform will allow us to more effectively meet the needs of our users and the community at large. During the transitional period between the two documentation interfaces, both systems will remain operational.

One of the reasons we have chose to migrate to this platform for is the fact that this documentation is
hosted on a separate server and content delivery network from the main OPRAmachine application and it will
not be impacted by server outages or maintenance issues. Since the launch of OPRAmachine in October, 2017
the site administration has received a number of inquiries from users of our platform.

## Help improve this documentation
We hope that this documentation will help answer some of the questions that we have commonly received from requesters and records custodians. The OPRAmachine administration also aims to communicate site technical issues and outages both on this platform and on the OPRAmachine blog (blog.opramachine.com).
While we aim for this documentation to be as complete as possible, there may be some things we are missing. Feel free to update the content of this site's pages, just click the **Edit this page** link displayed on top right of each page, and submit a pull request with your changes. Your changes will be deployed automatically when merged after review.

## Your feedback
Please reach out to the documentation's editor, Gavin Rozzi, www.gavinrozzi.com with any feedback about this documentation. Feedback may also be submitted to any other member of the OPRAmachine team for their consideration. Issues may be submitted via Github to any of our website repositories.
