## Welcome
The **OPRAmachine Documentation** [(docs.opramachine.com)](https://docs.opramachine.com/) is your destination for information on how the [OPRAmachine](https://opramachine.com/) website works, how the website's administration decisions are made, as well as guides on how to make requests for specific types of public records under the New Jersey Open Public Records Act using the OPRAmachine transparency platform.

## Help improve our documentation
We hope that this documentation will help answer some of the most common questions that we have received from requesters and records custodians. The OPRAmachine administration also aims to communicate site technical issues and outages both on this platform and on the OPRAmachine blog (blog.opramachine.com).
While we aim for this documentation to be as complete as possible, there may be some things we are missing.
