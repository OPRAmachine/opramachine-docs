Police body camera footage can be obtained under OPRA, however a special concern associated with it will inevitably be the large size of video files. For that reason, the video files produced by the body cameras are often too large to email. Police departments may request that you pay a fee to have the video burned onto a disc or loaded onto a USB flash drive. Keep this in mind when requesting body camera footage of specific incidents.
