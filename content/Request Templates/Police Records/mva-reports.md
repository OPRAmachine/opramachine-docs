Reports completed by police departments investigating motor vehicle accidents are obtainable under OPRA. Often, companies will file requests seeking copies of all motor vehicle accident reports for a given period of time. Police typically provide the reports in full, while redacting some sensitive personal information, such as drivers license numbers and insurance policy numbers.
