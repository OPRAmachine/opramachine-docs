The types of internal affairs records that the public can obtain under OPRA is limited to aggregate level summaries of cases that do not individually identify the officers that were involved in the case. Typically, the summary reports obtainable under OPRA will include a list of the types of cases and their disposition, such as whether the allegations were sustained or not.
