Since the New Jersey Supreme Court's holding in the case Paff v. Galloway Township, the public has been able to request fields of digital data, such as email logs.

Email logs consist of the metadata associated with a public employee's email account. They are almost like a snapshot of the account's email inbox, as it reveals the sender, recipient, subject and timestamp of each email stored on the public employee's email account.

Email logs can reveal who a public official is talking to and what they are saying. That's why they are a powerful tool for journalists and the public.
