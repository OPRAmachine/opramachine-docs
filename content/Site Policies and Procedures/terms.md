You are required to keep your username and password private and confidential and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. We reserve the right to suspend your access to the service at any time in our sole discretion, or for other reasons like unpaid fees and violation of these Terms of Service. You shall not use the site or your OPRAmachine.com account for any purpose competitive to OPRAmachine.com and you will notify OPRAmachine.com immediately of any unauthorized use of your OPRAmachine.com account. OPRAmachine.com may terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the site, or any portion thereof:

- if you provide any information that OPRAmachine.com determines, in its sole discretion, to be untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete (or if the information becomes untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete),

Nothing in this documentation or on the OPRAmachine website should be construed as legal advice or creating an attorney-client relationship. Only a licensed attorney licensed to practice in New Jersey can provide legal advice.

## 10.	Waiver and Severability.
Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between you and OPRAmachine.com and govern your use of the service, superseding any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.
