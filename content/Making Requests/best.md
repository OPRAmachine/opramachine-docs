Keep your request concise.
Be as specific as possible. Try and identify specific documents and use narrow date ranges. This helps the custodian to quickly locate the public records that are responsive to your request, and helps you avoid being charged special service fees due to the time required to fulfill your request, such as if it is exceedingly voluminous.
