A  batch request is the same OPRA request submitted to multiple governmental agencies at the same time. An individual may wish to submit this sort of request if they were doing comparative research about the differences between municipalities or counties or even particular public bodies.

Due to spam concerns, the ability to submit batch requests is currently limited and requests to enable them are currently considered on a case-by-case basis. If you are interested in making use of batch requests, please contact us to discuss your needs.
