A  **batch request** is the same OPRA request submitted to multiple governmental agencies at the same time. An individual may wish to submit this sort of request if they were doing comparative research about the differences between municipalities or counties or even particular public bodies.

For example, a good use case of a batch request was [this request](https://opramachine.com/info_request_batch/1) for police use of force reports from multiple municipalities in Ocean County.

Due to spam concerns, the ability to submit batch requests is currently limited. By default, registered users of OPRAmachine are not permitted to submit batch requests. Users who wish for us to enable batch requests for them are currently considered on a case-by-case basis. If you are interested in making use of batch requests, please contact us to discuss whether this would be a good fit for you.
