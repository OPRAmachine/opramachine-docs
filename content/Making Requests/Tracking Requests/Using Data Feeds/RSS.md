You can use **RSS** feeds to obtain data on requests and responses sent via the OPRAmachine platform. On most URLs of the site, you can simply preface links with /feed/ in order to obtain an RSS feed for a particular public body, user or request.

Local news websites have incorporated the RSS feeds by allowing their readers to view requests for a given government, such as a county or municipal government. You can use the RSS feeds to keep track of your town.

### Examples

[Successful OPRA requests (RSS)][1]

[1]: https://opramachine.com/feed/search/%20(latest_status:successful%20OR%20latest_status:partially_successful)

The website [Atlantic County News](https://atlanticcountynews.com) implemented this feed to display all requests sent to the Atlantic County government on their homepage. The same was done at [Ocean County Politics](https://politicsoc.com) for requests sent to the Ocean County government.

Implementing the RSS feed on your own website is simply a matter of copying and pasting the URL to a widget on WordPress-based websites.
