Making requests with OPRAmachine is easy.

Start by selecting the public authority you would like to send your OPRA request to. Please note that only New Jersey state and local governmental agencies are subject to the Open Public Records Act and its restrictions. The New Jersey Judiciary and Legislature are both exempt from OPRA, so any requests to those entities made under the law would be invalid.

Federal agencies, such as the FBI or DHS are not subject to OPRA. Their records can instead be accessed under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). OPRAmachine currently only supports requests made under OPRA. A future website may be added that supports making FOIA requests using a similar interface.
