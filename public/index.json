Consider breaking requests for these records into smaller requests.\n Governments hire attorneys for all for all sorts of legal matters. In many instances, a local government may end up hiring several law firms, with each firm covering a certain area of expertise. In many municipalities it\u0026rsquo;s not unusual to have separate attorneys for general legal matters, collective bargaining \u0026amp; labor relations and another for land use matters.\nYou can get an idea of what kinds of work a law firm is doing for a government agency by requesting copies of legal bills. If you are simply looking to get the amounts of money that are being paid to a certain law firm each month, a vendor history report would probably do the job instead.\nLegal bills are often a valuable source of information because they can reveal the identities of individuals involved in current or potential litigation against public entities. Along this vein, law firms often have attorney-client privileged information on detail billing that will need to be redacted. For this reason, it is best to have requests for legal bills be in as narrow of a timeframe as possible, such as requesting one month at a time, in order to avoid getting hit with \u0026ldquo;special service\u0026rdquo; fees.\nExample requests The following are example requests made for this type of record on OPRAmachine:\nhttps://opramachine.com/request/attorney_bills#incoming-1060\nhttps://opramachine.com/request/attorney_bills_5#incoming-702\nhttps://opramachine.com/request/attorney_bills_2#incoming-1358\n"

Removal Decisions Removal of content from the publicly visible website and database of requests is an extraordinary remedy that will only be deployed on a case by case basis based upon the totality of the circumstances and any mitigating factors - not solely along bright line criteria.\nSite administration intends for OPRAmachine to further governmental transparency and openness. We believe that the transparency provided by the site, including the publication of request and responses provides a public service and is essential to gaining a candid insight into the OPRA process. We will therefore only remove content (either that which was generated by users or provided by public bodies in response to a request when exceedingly persuasive justification is shown that the content\u0026rsquo;s publication will directly and substantially injure a private citizen, absent any legitimate journalistic or public interest in the continued publication of the challenged material on OPRAmachine.com.\nBefore removing content, the OPRAmachine site administration will conduct a public interest balancing test. We will balance the privacy interest expressed by the party requesting removal of the material with our journalistic interest in publishing the documents.

The settlement agreement recites some basic facts about the procedural history of a lawsuit before outlining the terms of the settlement. Typically, the plaintiff (the person who filed the lawsuit) is paid a sum of money to withdraw their litigation without the public body admitting any liability.\nSettlement agreements can be a useful tool for learning about the outcomes of litigation. Oftentimes, they are the only way of conclusively learning the end outcome of litigation against public bodies, as many times the settlement agreements will contain a confidentiality clause the prevents either the public body or the individual that sued them from speaking publicly about the events that gave rise to the litigation and settlement agreement, but courts have held that this confidentiality provision does not outweigh the public\u0026rsquo;s right to obtain a copy of the settlement agreement under OPRA\nExample requests The following are example requests made for this type of record on OPRAmachine:\nhttps://opramachine.com/request/settlement_agreement_robert_wyso\nhttps://opramachine.com/request/sexual_harassment_settlements\nhttps://opramachine.com/request/lt_laurie_cahill_whistleblower_l\n"

We have found that municipalities and counties have varied fairly wildly with the extent to which they redact personally identifying information from the request forms and emails sent requesting public records under OPRA.\nSome government agencies have imposed \u0026ldquo;special service\u0026rdquo; charges to requests that are seeking a high volume of records, such as OPRAs covering several months. As emphasized in past documentation pages, breaking a request into smaller requests for narrower periods of time is a good way to avoid being charged a fee for the records you are seeking.\nExample requests The following are example requests made for this type of record on OPRAmachine:\nhttps://opramachine.com/request/opra_requests_294#incoming-698\nhttps://opramachine.com/request/opra_requests_91#incoming-1510\nhttps://opramachine.com/request/opra_requests_29#incoming-282\n"

During the transitional period between the two documentation interfaces, both systems will remain operational.\nOne of the reasons we have chose to migrate to this platform for is the fact that this documentation is hosted on a separate server and content delivery network from the main OPRAmachine application and it will not be impacted by server outages or maintenance issues. Since the launch of OPRAmachine in October, 2017 the site administration has received a number of inquiries from users of our platform.\nHelp improve our documentation We hope that this documentation will help answer some of the questions that we have commonly received from requesters and records custodians. The OPRAmachine administration also aims to communicate site technical issues and outages both on this platform and on the OPRAmachine blog (blog.opramachine.com). While we aim for this documentation to be as complete as possible, there may be some things we are missing. Feel free to update the content of this site\u0026rsquo;s pages, just click the Edit this page link displayed on top right of each page, and submit a pull request with your changes. Your changes will be deployed automatically when merged after review.\nYour feedback Please reach out to the documentation\u0026rsquo;s editor, Gavin Rozzi, www.gavinrozzi.com with any feedback about this documentation. Feedback may also be submitted to any other member of the OPRAmachine team for their consideration. Issues may be submitted via Github to any of our website repositories.\n"
