Generally, we will require a showing of material and substantial harm to an individual that would come as a result of the continued publication of information on OPRAmachine.\nRemoval of content from the publicly visible website and database of requests is an extraordinary remedy that will only be deployed on a case by case basis based upon the totality of the circumstances and any mitigating factors - not solely along bright line criteria. Site administration intends for OPRAmachine to further governmental transparency and openness. We believe that the transparency provided by the site, including the publication of request and responses provides a public service and is essential to gaining a candid insight into the OPRA process. We will therefore only remove content (either that which was generated by users or provided by public bodies in response to a request when exceedingly persuasive justification is shown that the content\u0026rsquo;s publication will directly and substantially injure a private citizen, absent any legitimate journalistic or public interest in the continued publication of the challenged material on OPRAmachine.com.\nTypes of Content Subject To Removal Removal Decisions Before removing content, the OPRAmachine site administration will conduct a public interest balancing test. We will balance the privacy interest expressed by the party requesting removal of the material with our journalistic interest in publishing the documents. If we conclude that additional redactions or removal of the documents is necessary, we will attempt to work with the public body\u0026rsquo;s records custodian to provide a properly redacted version of the files.\n"

Then, once you are in possession of the email logs, use the email logs to formulate a future OPRA request where you request to see copies of the specific bodies of email messages of interest that you have identified from the email logs.\n"
