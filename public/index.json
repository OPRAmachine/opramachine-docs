	"content": " The OPRAmachine site administration will endeavor to remove site content in legitimate instances where private identifying information , such as social security numbers and dates of birth,\nRemove of content is an extraordinary remedy. The OPRAmachine site administration intends for the site to further governmental transparency and openness. We believe that the transparency provided by the site, including the publication of request and responses provides a public service. We will therefore only remove content when exceedingly persuasive justification is provided that the content\u0026rsquo;s publication will directly and substantially injure a private citizen.\nTypes of Content Subject To Removal Removal Decisions Before removing content, the OPRAmachine site administration will conduct a public interest balancing test. We will balance the privacy interest expressed by the party requesting removal of the material with our journalistic interest in publishing the documents. If we conclude that additional redactions or removal of the documents is necessary, we will attempt to work with the public body\u0026rsquo;s records custodian to provide a properly redacted version of the files.\n"

Galloway Township, the public has been able to request fields of digital data, such as email logs.\nEmail logs consist of the metadata associated with a public employee\u0026rsquo;s email account. They are almost like a snapshot of the account\u0026rsquo;s email inbox, as it reveals the sender, recipient, subject and timestamp of each email stored on the public employee\u0026rsquo;s email account.\nEmail logs can reveal who a public official is talking to and what they are saying. That\u0026rsquo;s why they are a powerful tool for journalists and the public.\n"

Beginning in 2018, this documentation website will supersede the existing help material that is currently hosted at the existing OPRAmachine website.\nOne of the reasons we have chose to migrate to this platform is the fact that this documentation is hosted on a separate server and content delivery network from the main OPRAmachine application and it will not be impacted by server outages or maintenance issues. The OPRAmachine administration aims to communicate site technical issues both on this platform and on the OPRAmachine blog (blog.opramachine.com).\nDocumentation website This current documentation has been statically generated with the Hugo static site generator with a simple command : hugo -t docdock \u0026ndash; the source code of this documentation is open source and available here at GitHub  \nContribute to this documentation Feel free to update this content, just click the Edit this page link displayed on top right of each page, and pullrequest it Your modification will be deployed automatically when merged.
