<h3 id="911-tapes">911 Tapes</h3>

<p>Serrano v. South Brunswick Twp., 358 N.J. Super. 352 (App. Div. 2003): The complainant
requested an audiotape of a 911 call in which a defendant allegedly killed his father three hours
after he placed the call. The Court affirmed the GRC’s decision (GRC Complaint No. 2002-33)
to release the tape.</p>

<ol>
<li>911 calls are required by law to be recorded by a government agency and these tapes
must be retained for “no less than 31 days.” (See N.J.S.A. 52:17C-1 and N.J.A.C. 17:24-
2.4).</li>
<li>911 tapes come within the definition of a government record for the purposes of OPRA.</li>
<li>The Court noted:
a. This case does not provide the opportunity for a definitive ruling on the question
   of whether 911 tapes are public records under OPRA.
b. The 911 caller himself made the existence of the call part of the public record in
   the pretrial proceedings of his criminal case and had expressly taken the position
   in these proceedings that he did not object to the release of the 911 tape. The court
   is not concluding that all 911 tapes are open to the public under OPRA. They
   decided that only under the circumstances of this case the prosecutor was not
   entitled to withhold this 911 tape from the public.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ponce v. Town of West New York, 2013 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 436 (App. Div. 2013):</p>

<p>Defendants appealed from a trial court’s ruling granting plaintiff’s application to review an
unredacted recording of a 911 call reporting an alleged illegal parking violation. The recording
reveals the identity of the caller who complained that plaintiff&rsquo;s car was blocking his driveway.
The trial court conducted a balancing test using the seven (7) factors discussed in Burnett v.
Cnty. of Bergen, 198 N.J. 408 (2009) and determined that the caller&rsquo;s ostensible expectation of
privacy in this context is subordinate to the public&rsquo;s right to access and review a “government
record,” as defined under OPRA. The Appellate Division affirmed, holding that ordinarily, a
citizen&rsquo;s identity when making a Title 39 complaint is easily accessible to the public as part of
the official police record, and that the recording does not reveal any personal or private
information. Further, the Court held that defendants&rsquo; fear concerning plaintiff&rsquo;s likelihood of
retaliation is based on mere speculation: “[d]efendants have not presented any evidence of past
hostility between these two individuals. Absent compelling reasons, which are conspicuously
absent in this record, few can argue that in a free society an accused is not entitled to know the
identity of his accuser.” Id. at 9-10.</p>

<h3 id="advisory-consultative-or-deliberative-acd-material">Advisory, Consultative or Deliberative (“ACD”) Material</h3>

<p>Educ. Law Ctr. v. NJ Dep’t of Educ., 198 N.J. 274 (2009): The Court held that “a record, which
contains or involves factual components, is entitled to deliberative-process protection when it
was used in the decision-making process and its disclosure would reveal deliberations that
occurred during that process.” Id. at 280.</p>

<p>Ciesla v. NJ Dep’t of Health &amp; Senior Serv., et als, 429 N.J. Super. 127 (App. Div. 2012): The
Court affirmed the GRC’s decision (GRC Complaint No. 2010-38) that the responsive staff
recommendation report constituted ACD material because it was a draft document.</p>

<h3 id="auto-accident-reports">Auto Accident Reports</h3>

<p>Donato v. Jersey City Police Dep’t, GRC Complaint No. 2005 - 251 (Interim Order dated
December 19, 2005): The Custodian charged $5.00 per accident report. Council ruled that
N.J.S.A. 39:4-131 states that auto accident reports are not privileged or confidential and that if
the request is not made in person, the custodian may charge up to $5.00 for each of the first three
pages and $1.00 per page thereafter in addition to the OPRA copy rates.</p>

<p><em>The GRC notes that N.J.S.A. 39:4-131 was amended on November 9, 2010 removing the
additional $1.00 charge for each page. See GRC’s “OPRA Alert” Volume 3, Issue 2 (November
2010).</em></p>

<p>Truland v. Borough of Madison, GRC Complaint No. 2006 - 88 (September 2007): The Custodian
charged $5.00 for each of the seven (7) reports plus OPRA’s per page copy fee. The Council
held that the Custodian has lawfully charged the Complainant $40.25 for the requested accident
reports pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:4-131. Further, the Council held that no redactions are warranted
on said reports.</p>

<h3 id="broad-and-or-unclear-requests">Broad and/or Unclear Requests</h3>

<p>MAG Entm’t, LLC v. Div. of Alcohol Beverage Control, 375 N.J. Super. 534 (App. Div. 2005):
The Court held that &ldquo;[w]hile OPRA provides an alternative means of access to government
documents not otherwise exempted from its reach, it is not intended as a research tool litigants
may use to force government officials to identify and siphon useful information. Rather, OPRA
simply operates to make identifiable government records ‘readily accessible for inspection,
copying, or examination.’ N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.&rdquo; (emphasis added). The Court further held that
&ldquo;[u]nder OPRA, agencies are required to disclose only ‘identifiable’ government records_ not
otherwise exempt&hellip; In short, OPRA does not countenance open-ended searches of an agency&rsquo;s
files.&rdquo; Id. at 549 (emphasis added).</p>

<p>Bent v. Stafford Police Department, 381 N.J. Super. 30 (App. Div. 2005): The Court affirmed the
GRC’s decision (GRC Complaint No. 2004-78) that the complainant’s request was broad and
unclear (“any and all”). The Council ruled that the information sought did not amount to an
identifiable government record.</p>

<p>NJ Builders Assoc. v. NJ Council on Affordable Hous., 390 N.J. Super. 166, 180 (App. Div.
2007 ): The requestor submitted a 5 page document listing 38 separate requests all of which
include a request for “any and all documents and data used or considered&hellip; supporting,
demonstrating, justifying or verifying” various determinations relevant to COAH’s
determinations about fair-share housing obligations. The Court held that the requestor did not
specifically identify the records sought, as required by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(f), and OPRA did not
require the custodian to produce the records within seven (7) business days pursuant to N.J.S.A.
47:1A-5(i).</p>

<p>Schuler v. Borough of Bloomsbury, GRC Complaint No. 2007-151 (Interim Order dated
December 19, 2007): The Council held that “[b]ecause the Complainant’s OPRA requests # 2- 5
are not requests for identifiable government records, the requests are invalid and the Custodian
has not unlawfully denied access to the requested records pursuant to MAG Entm’t, LLC v. Div.
of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 375 N.J. Super. 534 (App. Div. 2005) and Bent v. Stafford
Police Dep’t, 381 N.J. Super. 30 (App. Div. 2005).” Id. at 9.</p>

<p>Elcavage v. West Milford Twp. (Passaic), GRC Complaint No. 2009-07 (April 2010): The
Council held that “an OPRA request for an e-mail or e-mails shall therefore focus upon the
following four (4) characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content and/or subject</li>
<li>Specific date or range of dates</li>
<li>Sender</li>
<li>Recipient</li>
</ul>

<p>In accord with MAG, supra, and its progeny, in order to specifically identify an e-mail, OPRA
requests must contain (1) the content and/or subject of the e-mail, (2) the specific date or range
of dates during which the e-mail was transmitted or the e-mails were transmitted, and (3) a valid
e-mail request must identify the sender and/or the recipient thereof.” Id. at 5. See also Armenti v.
Robbinsville Bd. of Educ. (Mercer), GRC Complaint No. 2009-154 (Interim Order dated May
24, 2011)(applying the Elcavage, factors to other written correspondence).</p>

<p>Burnett v. Cnty. of Gloucester, 415 N.J. Super. 506 (App. Div. 2010): The Court evaluated a
request for “[a]ny and all settlements, releases or similar documents entered into, approved or
accepted from 1/1/2006 to present.” Id. at 508 (emphasis added). Upon review, the Court
determined that the request sought a specific type of document, although it did not specify a
particular case to which such document pertained, and was therefore not overly broad. Id. at 515-
16.</p>

<p>Burke v. Brandes, 429 N.J. Super. 169 (App. Div. 2012): The Court reversed the trial court’s
decision by holding that plaintiff’s request for “EZ Pass benefits afforded to retirees of the Port
Authority, including all&hellip; correspondence between the Office of the Governor&hellip; and the Port
Authority.. .” was valid under OPRA because it “was confined to a specific subject matter that
was clearly and reasonably described with sufficient identifying information&hellip; [and] was
limited to particularized identifiable government records, namely, correspondence with another
government entity, rather than information generally.” Id. at 176. The Court noted that plaintiff
had “narrowed the scope of the inquiry to a discrete and limited subject matter,” and that
fulfilling the request would involve “no research or analysis, but only a search for, and
production of,” identifiable government records. The Court reasoned that “the fact that the
custodian of records in this case actually performed a search and was able to locate and identify
records responsive to plaintiff&rsquo;s request belies any assertion that the request was lacking in
specificity or was overbroad.” Id. at 177.</p>

<h3 id="building-plans">Building Plans</h3>

<p>Cardillo v. City of Hoboken Zoning Office, GRC Complaint No. 2005-158 (December 2006):
The complainant sought access to renovation plans of a property. The Council held that “[t]he
legend, general notes, title of the document and all items contained under the architect firm name
should be disclosed. The remainder of the document, which includes the design schematics and
plans, is exempt from disclosure and should be redacted pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. This
information contains security information which would jeopardize the building and persons
therein. The exempt portion of this document contains information about the removal and
remainder of doors and windows and the location of all rooms inside which could jeopardize the
security of the building and the persons residing in the building.”</p>

<p>Kohn v. Twp. of Livingston (Essex), GRC Complaint No. 2007-319 (July 2008): The
complainant sought access to floor plans for the new municipal complex. The Council held that,
“[t]he requested floor plans are exempt from disclosure for containing security information or
procedures for any building facility which, if disclosed, would jeopardize security of the building
or facility or persons therein pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47 :1A-1.1.” Id. at 9.</p>

<h3 id="clarification">Clarification</h3>

<p>Moore v. Twp. of Old Bridge, GRC Complaint No. 2005 - 80 (August 2005): The custodian
responded to the complainant’s OPRA request seeking clarification because she believed same
was overly broad. However, the complainant did not respond to custodian’s request for
clarification of request. The Council concluded that the custodian did not unlawfully deny access
because she reasonably sought clarification of the request and the complainant failed to provide
same (citing Liebel v. Manalapan Englishtown Reg’l Bd. of Educ., GRC Complaint No. 2004- 51
(September 2004)).</p>

<h3 id="commercial-use-of-government-records">Commercial Use of Government Records</h3>

<p>Spaulding v. Cnty. of Passaic, GRC Complaint No. 2004-199 (September 2006): The Council
held that “there is no restriction against commercial use under OPRA and it is not the province of
the GRC to rule on this public policy aspect.”</p>

<h3 id="copy-cost">Copy Cost</h3>

<p>O’Shea v. Pine Hill Bd. of Educ. (Camden), GRC Complaint No. 2007- 192 (February 2009):
The custodian proposed a charge of $10.00 to disclose an audio recording of a public meeting to
the complainant. The complainant filed a Denial of Access Complaint disputing that the charge
represented the “actual cost” to provide the recording. During the pendency of the complaint, the
custodian provided the GRC a quote from an outside vendor for $10.48 and certified that they
did not have the capability to duplicate audiotape. The Council held that $10.48 was reasonable
and warranted, reasoning that “evidence of record indicates that the Board does not have the
resources to duplicate the requested record itself and must therefore contract with an outside
vendor to do so.” Id. at 9.</p>

<p>Livecchia v. Borough of Mt. Arlington (Morris), GRC Complaint No. 2008-80 (April 2010): The
Council held that “[i]t is reasonable for a custodian to charge a requestor the actual postage cost
associated with delivering records by mail. The Custodian in the matter before the Council must
charge actual postage cost, not the anticipated postage cost associated with delivery by mail of
the requested records.”</p>

<p>Paff v. Twp. of Teaneck (Bergen), GRC Complaint No. 2010-09 (Interim Order dated May 24,
2011): The Council held that “[a]lthough the actual cost of providing records electronically is
likely $0.00 pursuant to [Paff v. Gloucester City (Camden), GRC Complaint No. 2009- 102
(Interim Order dated April 8, 2010)], because the Custodian had to make copies to redact the
requested minutes prior to providing same electronically, the Custodian’s charge of $6.
represents the actual cost to provide the records to the Complainant pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-
5(b).” Id. at 17.</p>

<p>Reid v. NJ Dep’t of Corrections, GRC Complaint No. 2010-83 (Final Decision dated May 24,
2011): The Council held that, “[b]ased on the court’s holding in [In re Adoption of a Child by
M.W., 116 N.J. Super. 506 (App. Div. 1971)], R. 1:13-2(a) contains no language relieving the
Complainant from paying the appropriate copying costs because he is indigent. Thus, the
Complainant must pay the proposed copy cost of $32.25 in order to receive the records at issue
in this complaint.” Id. at 10. The Council’s decision was later affirmed on appeal. Reid v. GRC
&amp; NJ Dep&rsquo;t of Corrections, 2013 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 2625 (App. Div. 2013).</p>

<h3 id="copyright">Copyright</h3>

<p>Grauer v. NJ Dep’t of Treasury, GRC Complaint No. 2007 - 03 (November 2007): The Council
held that “[b]ased on the court’s holding in Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington Cnty. v.
Robert Bradley Tombs, 215 Fed. Appx 80 (3d Cir. NJ 2006) and the GRC’s decision in Albrecht
v. NJ Dep’t of Treasury, GRC Complaint No. 2006-191 (July 25, 2007), copyright law does not
prohibit access to a government record which is otherwise available under OPRA.”</p>

<h3 id="criminal-investigatory-records">Criminal Investigatory Records</h3>

<p>Janeczko v. NJ Dep’t of Law and Pub. Safety, Div. of Criminal Justice, GRC Complaint Nos.
2002 - 79 and 2002- 80 (August 2003): The Council ruled that the records were exempt under the
criminal investigatory exemption from disclosure and that this exemption does not permit access
to the records even after the investigation is closed. The Council’s decision was appealed and
affirmed in an unpublished opinion of the Appellate Division of Superior Court in May 2004.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Shea v. Twp. of West Milford, 410 N.J. Super. 371 (App. Div. 2009): The Appellate Division
stated that a record must meet the statutory two-prong test to be considered a “criminal
investigatory record” exempt from disclosure under OPRA: that the record is “‘not be required
by law to be made,’ and the record must ‘pertain[] to any criminal investigation or related civil
enforcement proceeding.’” Id. at 371. Additionally, the GRC cannot accept an assertion that a
record is criminal investigatory in nature in “the absence of a factual showing that [the records]
pertained to an actual criminal investigation or to an existing related civil enforcement
proceeding.. .” Id. at 385.</p>

<p>Solloway v. Bergen Cnty. Prosecutor’s Office, GRC Complaint No. 2011-39 (January 2013): In
applying the “criminal investigatory” exemption to certain police reports, the Council reversed
its decision in Morgano v. Essex Cnty. Prosecutor’s Office, GRC Complaint No. 2007- 156
(Interim Order dated February 27, 2008)(which held that retention schedules have the force of
law). The Council reasoned that the definition of “criminal investigatory records” is problematic
because the State Records Commission created retention schedules that require agencies to
“maintain” various types of these records. The Council noted that this reversal is based on the
Supreme Court’s interpretation of criminal investigatory records, as well as the fact that applying
retention schedules would potentially render the exemption meaningless. Thus, the Council held
that “it can be concluded that in passing OPRA, the Legislature intended to preserve the then-
existing state of the law with respect to the disclosure of criminal investigatory records, i.e., that
the [Records Management Services’] record retention schedules do not operate to render criminal
investigatory records disclosable under OPRA.” Id. at 8.</p>

<h3 id="custodian-not-obligated-to-create-records-or-provide-after-creation">Custodian Not Obligated to Create Records or Provide After Creation</h3>

<p>Matthews v. City of Atlantic City (Atlantic), GRC Complaint No. 2008-123 (February 2009):
The Council decided that a custodian “was under no obligation to create a list compatible to the
Complainant’s OPRA request because OPRA does not require a Custodian to produce new
documents.. .” Id. at 6.</p>

<p>Librizzi v. Twp. of Verona Police Dep’t, GRC Complaint No. 2009-213 (August 2010): The
Council held that the custodian was under no obligation to create a record in response to the
complainant’s OPRA request.</p>

<p>Goeckel v. Chatham Borough Police Dep’t (Morris), GRC Complaint No. 2013-356 (July 2014):
The Council noted that “[t]he GRC has determined that a custodian was under no obligation to
provide a record that had not been created at the time of an OPRA request. Blau v. Union Cnty.,
GRC Complaint No. 2003-75 (January 2005); Paff v. v. Neptune Twp. Hous. Auth. (Monmouth),
GRC Complaint No. 2010-307 (Interim Order dated April 25, 2012); Delbury v. Greystone Park
Psychiatric Hosp. (Morris), GRC Complaint No. 2013-240 (Interim Order dated April 29,
2014).” Id. at 3.</p>

<h3 id="deemed-denial">Deemed Denial</h3>

<p>Kelley v. Twp. of Rockaway, GRC Complaint No. 2007- 11 (Interim Order October 31, 2007): A
custodian’s failure to respond in writing to a complainant’s OPRA request either granting access,
denying access, seeking clarification or requesting an extension of time within the statutorily
mandated seven (7) business days results in a “deemed” denial of the complainant’s OPRA
request. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(g); N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(i).</p>

<h3 id="discovery-vs-opra">Discovery vs. OPRA</h3>

<p>Mid-Atlantic Recycling Technologies, Inc., v. City of Vineland, 222 F.R.D. 81, (April 27, 2004):
The corporation filed a complaint against defendants, alleging that defendants engaged in
arbitrary and irrational conduct in an effort to deprive it of its business through selective
enforcement of certain environmental compliance policies. Defendants asserted that the city
received numerous requests under OPRA for documents related to issues in the case. Defendants
requested that the court enter a protective order precluding the corporation from conducting
discovery outside the limitations imposed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court
found that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure did not act as an automatic bar of a litigant&rsquo;s
rights to obtain or seek documents under a public record access statute, such as OPRA. The court
further found that defendants did not show good cause for a protection order by demonstrating a
particular need for protection. Defendants&rsquo; broad allegations of harm were not substantiated. The
court rejected defendants&rsquo; arguments that Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 limited or restricted a party&rsquo;s right to
request documents under OPRA.</p>

<p>Bart v. City of Passaic (Passaic), GRC Complaint No. 2007-162 (April 2008): The Council held
that the custodian’s denial of the OPRA request on the grounds that the complainant could only
obtain the requested records through discovery, is not a lawful basis for a denial of access.</p>

<h3 id="extensions">Extensions</h3>

<p>Rivera v. City of Plainfield Police Dep’t (Union), GRC Complaint No. 2009-317 (May 2011):
The custodian responded to the complainant’s request in writing on the fourth (4th) business day
following receipt of such request, requesting an extension of time to respond to the request and
providing an anticipated deadline date when the requested records would be made available. The
complainant did not agree to the custodian’s request for an extension of time. However, the
Council determined that because the custodian requested an extension of time in writing within
the statutorily mandated seven (7) business days and provided an anticipated deadline date when
the requested records would be made available, the custodian properly requested said extension
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(g), N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(i).</p>

<p>Criscione v. Town of Guttenberg (Hudson), GRC Complaint No. 2010-68 (November 2010):
The Council determined that, notwithstanding the fact that the complainant did not agree to the
extension of time requested by the custodian, the extension was proper “&hellip; because the
Custodian provided a written response requesting an extension on the sixth (6th) business day
following receipt of the Complainant’s OPRA request and provid[ed] a date certain on which to
expect production of the records requested.. .” Id. at 6.</p>

<p>Ciccarone v. NJ Dep’t of Treasury, GRC Complaint No. 2013-280 (Interim Order dated July 29,
2 014): The custodian sought a total of seven ( 7 ) extensions totaling fifty-two (52) business days.
The complainant initially agreed to the first four (4) extensions, but noted that no further
extensions would be granted. The Council, noting that extensions are rooted in well settled case
law, decided that an additional twenty-seven (27) business days “following expiration of the last
agreed-upon extension of time in order to address the balance of the Complainant’s request is
clearly an excessive amount of time and flies in the face of OPRA’s mandate to ‘&hellip; promptly
comply.. .’ with a records request.. .” Id. at 9. The Council thus determined that the
custodian’s excessive extensions resulted in a “deemed” denial based on the specific facts of this
complaint.</p>

<h3 id="frivolous-requests-complaints">Frivolous Requests &amp; Complaints</h3>

<p>Caggiano v. Borough of Stanhope (Sussex), GRC Complaint Nos. 2007-20, 2007-21, 2007-22 &amp;
2007 - 23 (September 2007): The Council held that “[t]he following evidence of record supports
the conclusion that the Complainant in these consolidated Denial of Access Complaints
commenced these complaints ‘in bad faith, solely for the purpose of harassment[:]’</p>

<pre><code>a. the Complainant filed four (4) separate OPRA requests for identical records within a few
days of each other;
b. in each OPRA request, the Complainant failed to wait until the expiration of the
statutorily-mandated seven (7) business day response period at N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5.i before
he filed another OPRA request for identical records;
c. the Custodian offered the requested records to the Complainant on July 25, 2006 and
September 12, 2006 when the contracts were received by the Borough, but the
Complainant refused to accept the records and denied that they were contracts;
d. in spite of the disclosure of the requested records (whether or not the Complainant agreed
with the content of those records), the Complainant filed the instant Denial of Access
Complaints with the GRC;
e. the Complainant failed to inform the GRC in any of his filings that the Custodian had
made available to him the requested records prior to the filing of the Complainant’s
Denial of Access Complaints;
f. in his May 21, 2007 letter to the Custodian, the Complainant threatens to file “five
separate complaints for each contract not being immediately available[,]” which is prima
facie evidence of the Complainant’s ongoing bad faith and intention to harass the
Custodian and the Borough of Stanhope in these consolidated complaints; and
g. the extremely high number and frequency of OPRA requests filed by the Complainant
with the Borough of Stanhope in 2006 and 2007.
</code></pre>

<p>The complaints herein should therefore be dismissed as frivolous pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-
7(e).” Id. at 9.</p>

<p>Valdes v. Union City Bd. of Educ. (Hudson), GRC Complaint No. 2013- 147 et seq.: The Council
determined that portions of the complainant’s Denial of Access Complaint were frivolous
because “the evidence of record shows that the Complainant knew, or should have known, that
the complaints filed&hellip; [were] without any reasonable basis in law or equity and could not be
supported by a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.”
Id. at 14. The Council based this decision on the fact that the complainant previously filed
multiple complaints based on similar requests for the same records and the complainant’s
acknowledgement of the Council’s previous decisions denying same as valid requests.</p>

<h3 id="grand-jury-records">Grand Jury Records</h3>

<p>Dunn v. Burlington Cnty. Prosecutor’s Office, GRC 2013-218 (January 2014). The Council
concluded that the custodian had lawfully denied access because the complainant requested
grand jury materials, including audio or video transcripts, and, pursuant to N.J. Court Rules and
precedent, such materials may not be disclosed without a demonstration of “compelling circumstances”, or a “strong showing of particularized need[,]” and court approval through “a two-step judicial determination that such a turnover will be consistent with both the policies furthered by grand jury secrecy and the deterrence of abuse of grand jury process.” See State v. Doliner 96 N.J. 236 245, 246, 246 n.2, 256 (1984). See also Maniscalco v. Atlantic Cnty. Prosecutor’s Office, GRC Complaint No. 2012-247 (July 2013).</p>

<h3 id="grc-s-authority">GRC’s Authority</h3>

<p>Kawanzaa v. NJ Dep’t of Corrections, GRC Complaint No. 2004 - 167 (March 2005): The
Council does not have authority over content of records pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-7(b). See
also DiCampli v NJ State Police, GRC Complaint No. 2013-338 (July 2014).</p>

<p>Toscano v. NJ Dep’t of Labor, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services, GRC Complaint
No. 2007-296 (March 2008): The Council does not have authority over records retention
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-7(b).</p>

<p>Paff v. Neptune Twp. Housing Auth. (Monmouth), GRC Complaint No. 2010-307 (Interim
Order dated April 25, 2012): The Council does not have the authority to adjudicate whether a
custodian is complying with the Open Public Meetings Act.</p>

<h3 id="identity-of-requestor-is-irrelevant">Identity of Requestor is Irrelevant</h3>

<p>White v. William Patterson Univ., GRC Complaint No. 2008-216 (August 2009): The Council
held that the identity of a requestor is not a consideration when deciding whether an exemption
applies to a government record requested pursuant to OPRA except for those instances set forth
at N.J.S.A. 47:1A-2.2 and N.J.S.A. 47:1A-10. See also Cicero v. NJ Dep’t of Children &amp; Family
Serv., Div. of Child Behavioral Serv., GRC Complaint No. 2009-201 (Final Decision dated
August 24, 2010)</p>

<p>Riley v. NJ Dep’t of Corrections, GRC Complaint No. 2013- 3 45 (July 29, 2014): The Council
determined that the Custodian lawfully denied access to the requested mental health records.
Groelly v. NJ Dep’t of Corrections, GRC Complaint No. 2010-294 (June 2012) and McLawhorn
v. NJ Dep’t of Corrections, GRC Complaint No. 2012-292 (July 2013)(holding that mental
health records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to EO 26, even when a complainant sought
their own records).</p>

<h3 id="illegible-records">Illegible Records</h3>

<p>Lopez v. Cnty. of Hudson, GRC Complaint No. 2009-267 (March 2011): The Council held that,
“[t]he Custodian’s provision of illegible records to the Complainant in response to the OPRA
request when legible records existed constitutes a limitation on the right of access accorded by
OPRA pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 and a violation of OPRA.” See also Wolosky v. Borough of
Mt. Arlington (Morris), GRC Complaint No. 2010-194 (Interim Order dated November 29,
2011); Scheeler, Jr. v. Woodbine Bd. of Educ. (Cape May), GRC Complaint No. 2014- 59
(Interim Order dated January 30, 2015).</p>

<h3 id="immediate-access">Immediate Access</h3>

<p>Herron v. Twp. of Montclair, GRC Complaint No. 2006-178 (February 2007): The Council held
that “immediate access language of OPRA (N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(e)) suggests that the Custodian
was still obligated to immediately notify the Complainant.. .” Inasmuch as OPRA requires a
custodian to respond within a statutorily required time frame, when immediate access records are
requested, a custodian must respond to the request for those records immediately, granting or
denying access, requesting additional time to respond or requesting clarification of the request.</p>

<p>Renna v. Cnty. of Union, GRC Complaint No. 2008 - 110 (March 2009): The Council held that
because a completed version of the requested record did not exist in the medium requested at the
time of the Complainant’s OPRA request and required medium conversion pursuant to N.J.S.A.
47:1A- 5 (d), and because the Custodian provided the Complainant access to the requested record
in the medium requested immediately after the medium conversion was completed, the
Custodian did not violate N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(e).</p>

<p>Kohn v. Twp. of Livingston (Essex), GRC Complaint No. 2011-330 (Final Decision dated
February 26, 2013): The Council held that the Custodian had an obligation to respond to the
Complainant’s request item for salary “&hellip; immediately, even if said records are part of a larger
request containing a combination of records requiring a response within seven (7) business days
and immediate access records requiring an immediate response.. .” Id. at 5.</p>

<h3 id="informing-of-record-location-instead-of-providing-access">Informing of Record Location Instead of Providing Access</h3>

<p>Langford v. City of Perth Amboy, GRC Complaint No. 2005 - 181 (May 2007): The Council held
that the Custodian should have provided the Complainant with the requested rules (of which the
City was presumably in possession) instead of informing the Complainant where the requested
rules are located (the Director of Human Services office). As such, the Custodian violated
N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.</p>

<p>Rodriguez v. Kean Univ., GRC Complaint No. 2013-69 (March 2014): The Council reversed its
prior decision in Kaplan v. Winslow Twp. Bd. of Educ. (Camden), Complaint No. 2009- 148
(Interim Order dated June 29, 2010) by providing that custodians have the ability to refer
requestors to the exact location on the Internet where a responsive record can be located. Id. at 3-</p>

<ol>
<li>The Council noted that a custodian’s ability to direct a requestor to the specific location of a
government record on the Internet is contingent upon on the requestor’s ability to electronically
access the records. A custodian is not absolved from providing the record in hardcopy if the
requestor is unable to obtain the information from the Internet and makes it known to the
custodian within seven (7) business days after receipt of the custodian’s response, in which case
the custodian will have seven (7) business days from the date of such notice to disclose the
record(s) in hardcopy. Id. at 4.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="insufficient-response">Insufficient Response</h3>

<p>O’Shea v. Twp. of West Milford, GRC 2004-17 (April 2005): The Council held that the
custodian’s initial response that the complainant’s request was a duplicate of a previous request
was legally insufficient because the Custodian has a duty to answer each request individually. A
custodian is vested with the responsibility to respond to each individual request item within
seven (7) business days after receipt of such request.</p>

<p>Paff v. Borough of Lavallette (Ocean), GRC Complaint No. 2007-209 (Interim Order dated May
24, 2011): The Council held that the custodian’s response was insufficient because he failed to
provide the specific lawful basis for each redaction made to executive session minutes (citing
Schwarz v. NJ Dep’t of Human Serv., GRC Complaint No. 2004 - 60 (February 2005)).</p>

<p>Paff v. Willingboro Bd. of Educ. (Burlington), GRC Complaint No. 2007-272 (May 2008): The
Council held that the custodian’s failure to respond to each request item individually resulted in
an insufficient response.</p>

<p>Rivera v. City of Camden (Camden), GRC Complaint No. 2010-182 (Interim Order dated
January 31, 2012): The Council determined that the custodian’s response was insufficient
because he failed to identify the specific lawful basis for each redaction made to monthly billing
records pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47 :1A-5(g).</p>

<p>Herron v. NJ Dep’t of Educ., GRC Complaint No. 2011-56 (April 2012): The custodian’s
response was insufficient because she failed to definitively state whether responsive records
existed. See also Verry v. Borough of South Bound Brook (Somerset), GRC Complaint No.
2008 - 48 (Interim Order dated March 25, 2009).</p>

<p>Papiez v. Cnty. of Mercer, Office of the Cnty. Counsel, GRC Complaint No. 2012-59 (March
2013): The Council determined that although the custodian timely sought an extension of time,
she failed to provide a date certain on which she would respond. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(i). See also
Verry v. Borough of South Bound Brook (Somerset), GRC Complaint No. 2008-48 (Interim
Order dated March 25, 2009); Kohn v. Twp. of Livingston (Essex), GRC Complaint No. 2011-
327 (February 2013).</p>

<h3 id="insufficient-search">Insufficient Search</h3>

<p>Schneble v. NJ Dep’t of Envtl. Protection, GRC Complaint No. 2007-220 (April 2008): The
custodian initially responded to the complainant’s OPRA request by stating that no records
responsive existed. The complainant, however, submitted e-mails that were responsive to her
request with the Denial of Access Complaint. The custodian certified that, upon receipt of the e-
mails attached to the Denial of Access Complaint, the custodian again searched through DEP
files and located records responsive to the request. The GRC held that because the custodian
performed an inadequate initial search, the custodian unlawfully denied the Complainant access
to the requested records. See also Lebbing v. Borough of Highland Park (Middlesex), GRC
Complaint No. 2009- 251 (January 2011).</p>

<h3 id="judiciary-records">Judiciary Records</h3>

<p>Tomkins v. City of Newark Mun. Court, GRC Complaint No. 2013-159 (July 2013): The
Council administratively dismissed this complaint because it does not have jurisdiction over requests made to the Judiciary. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-7(g).</p>

<h3 id="lawful-basis-required-at-time-of-denial">Lawful Basis Required At Time of Denial</h3>

<p>Schwarz v. NJ Dep’t of Human Serv., GRC Complaint No. 2004 - 60 (February 2005): The
Custodian did not provide specific citations to OPRA and HIPAA. Council ruled that the
custodian bears the burden of proving that a denial of access is lawful pursuant to N.J.S.A.
47:1A-6. This means that specific citations to the law (OPRA or other law) that allows a denial
of access are required at the time of the denial and must be included in the Statement of
Information.</p>

<h3 id="litigation">Litigation</h3>

<p>Darata v. Monmouth Cnty. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, GRC Complaint No. 2009-312 (Interim
Order dated February 24, 2011): The Council held that, “[t]he GRC notes that pending litigation
is not a lawful basis for denial of access to records requested under OPRA. OPRA provides a
statutory right of access to government records which is not in any way supplanted by pending or
ongoing litigation.” Id. at 8. See also Paff v. City of Union City (Hudson), GRC Complaint No.
2013 - 195 (Interim Order dated January 28, 2014) at 3.</p>

<h3 id="location-of-government-record-not-relevant">Location of Government Record Not Relevant</h3>

<p>Meyers v. Borough of Fair Lawn, GRC Complaint No. 2005-127 (Final Decision dated
December 8, 2005): The complainant sought e-mails from the Mayor’s personal e-mail account.
The custodian claimed that the e-mails were not government records because they were not
maintained in the custodian’s files. The Council concluded that the Mayor conducted
government business through a personal e-mail account, thus making those e-mails government
records according to the definition of a government record in OPRA. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1.</p>

<p>Burnett v. Cnty. of Gloucester, 415 N.J. Super. 506 (App. Div. 2010): The Court determined that
defendants were required to obtain from their insurance broker settlement agreements made and
maintained on behalf of the County. The Court reasoned that “[w]ere we to conclude otherwise,
a governmental agency seeking to protect its records from scrutiny could simply delegate their
creation to third parties or relinquish possession to such parties, thereby thwarting the policy of
transparency that underlies OPRA. N.J.S.A. 47:1A- 1 .” Id. at 517.</p>

<p>Michalak v. Borough of Helmetta (Middlesex), GRC Complaint No. 2010-220 (Interim Order
dated January 31, 2012): The Council held that the custodian was required to obtain responsive
dispatch records from Spotswood Police Department because the Borough had entered into an
interlocal (or shared services) agreement with Spotswood to operate their dispatch log. The
Council reasoned that: “[s]imilar to a third party agreement between a public agency and a
private entity&hellip; the records responsive&hellip; were records “made, maintained or kept on file” for
the Borough by the [Spotswood Police Department] pursuant to said agreement. As in Burnett,
the responsive dispatch logs were created on behalf of the Borough by the SPD. Additionally, as
previously held in Meyers, the location of the requested records is immaterial.. .” Id. at 10.</p>

<h3 id="meeting-minutes">Meeting Minutes</h3>

<p>Parave-Fogg v. Lower Alloways Creek Twp., GRC Complaint No. 2006-51 (August 2006): The
Council held that draft, unapproved meeting minutes are exempt from disclosure as “inter-
agency or intra-agency advisory, consultative, or deliberative” material which is not included
within the definition of a government record. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1.</p>

<p>Miller v. Westwood Reg’l Sch. Dist. (Bergen), GRC Complaint No. 2009-49 (April 2010): The
Council held that a recording of an agency’s public meeting used to draft the agency’s official
meeting minutes is not deliberative in nature; therefore, such recording is not exempt from
disclosure under OPRA as advisory, consultative or deliberative material (citing In Re
Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co., 165 N.J. 75 (2000), Educ. Law Ctr. v. NJ Dep’t of Educ., 198
N.J. 274 (2009) and Burlett v. Monmouth Cnty. Bd. of Freeholders, GRC Complaint No. 2004-
75 (August 2004).</p>

<p>Merckx v. Twp. of Franklin Bd. of Educ. (Gloucester), GRC Complaint No. 2009 - 47 (April
2010): The Council held that because all of the requested closed session minutes were approved
by the Board of Education at the time of the complainant’s OPRA request, they no longer
constituted advisory, consultative or deliberative material pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. A
second approval by the governing body for public release of the requested minutes is not
required because N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(g) allows for the redaction of information that is exempt from
disclosure under OPRA. In fact, OPRA requires the disclosure of a record with redactions of
only the information which is asserted to be exempt from disclosure. A denial of access to the
entire record is therefore unlawful under OPRA.</p>

<h3 id="method-of-request-submission">Method of Request Submission</h3>

<p>Paff v. City of East Orange, 407 N.J. Super. 221 (App. Div. 2009): The Court stated that the
custodian&rsquo;s refusal to accept OPRA requests via fax is reasonable but that a custodian may not
exercise his/her authority under OPRA in a manner that would impose an unreasonable obstacle
to the transmission of a request for a government record. The Court also stated that OPRA&rsquo;s
requirement that custodians adopt a request form authorizes custodians to direct how government
records requests can be transmitted as specified in the form, which need not include every
method of transmission mentioned in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(g).</p>

<p>Roundtree v. NJ Dep’t of State, GRC Complaint No. 2013-260 (June 2014): The Council held
that NJ Department of State’s policy not to accept OPRA requests via e-mail does not impose an
unreasonable obstacle to the transmission of a request for a government record because DOS
accepts requests via mail, hand-delivery and OPRA Central. See Paff, 407 N.J. Super. 221.</p>

<h3 id="no-records-exist">No Records Exist</h3>

<p>Pusterhofer v. NJ Dep’t of Educ., GRC Complaint No. 2005 - 49 (July 2005): The Council
determined that no unlawful denial of access occurred because the custodian certified that no
responsive records existed and there was no evidence in the record to refute her certification. See
also Pavlenko v. Twp. of Delran (Burlington), GRC Complaint No. 2010-325 (March 2012).</p>

<p>Akers v. Buena Vista Twp. (Atlantic), GRC Complaint No. 2014-190 (November 2014): The
custodian certified that she (and others) conducted multiple searches for responsive records over
a four (4) day period, but was unable to locate same. The Council determined that the custodian
did not deny access to responsive records because none existed. Citing Kasko v. Town of
Westfield (Union), GRC Complaint No. 2011-06 (March 2012).</p>

<h3 id="ongoing-continuing-requests">Ongoing/Continuing Requests</h3>

<p>Blau v. Union Cnty. Clerk, GRC Complaint No. 2003-75 (November 2003): The complainant
sought access to copies of deeds and mortgages on an ongoing basis. The Council held that,
“[t]he request for copies ‘on a continuing basis’ is not valid under OPRA and that the requestor
must submit a new OPRA request to the custodian for each new batch of documents sought.” Id.</p>

<p>Paff v. Neptune Twp. Housing Auth. (Monmouth), GRC Complaint No. 2010-307 (Interim
Order dated April 25, 2012): The Council held that if the complainant wanted access to approved
meeting minutes, he would have to submit a new OPRA request once the minutes were
approved. Donato v. Borough of Emerson, GRC Complaint No. 2005-125 (Interim Order dated
February 28, 2007).</p>

<h3 id="ongoing-investigation">Ongoing Investigation</h3>

<p>Henderson v. NJ Dep’t of Law and Pub. Safety, Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, GRC
Complaint No. 2010-139 (May 2011): The Council held that, “[t]he requested records pertain to
an ongoing investigation conducted by the [the Division of] Alcoholic Beverage Control, and
disclosure of such records would be inimical to the public interest because such disclosure would
jeopardize the state agency’s ability to conduct such investigation; thus, the Custodian lawfully
denied access to such records. N.J.S.A. 47:1A- 3 (a); N.J.S.A. 47:1A-6.” Id. at 13. See also Norcia
v. Borough of North Arlington (Bergen), GRC Complaint No. 2011-133 (June 2012).</p>

<h3 id="opra-request-forms">OPRA Request Forms</h3>

<p>Renna v. Cnty. of Union, 407 N.J. Super. 230 (App. Div. 2009): The Court held that “the form
should be used, but no request for information should be rejected if such form is not used.” Id. at</p>

<ol>
<li>Thus, custodians must respond to records requests in accordance with the requirements of
OPRA for requests on an agency’s official OPRA request form, as well as written non-form
records request which mention “OPRA.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Gatson v. Borough of Cliffside Park Police Dep’t (Bergen), GRC Complaint No. 2009- 239
(October 2010): The Council held that, “[b]ecause a custodian may not refuse a request for
records made under OPRA which is in writing and clearly invokes OPRA, and because the
evidence of record indicates that the request form used by the Complainant clearly invoked
OPRA, the Custodian’s denial of access to the records requested violates OPRA pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 47:1A- 5 (g) and [Renna, 407 N.J. Super. at 230].” Id. at 5.</p>

<p>Wolosky v. Twp. of East Hanover (Morris), GRC Complaint No. 2010-185 (Interim Order dated
January 31, 2012): The Council determined that the Township’s official OPRA request form was
not in compliance with N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(f)(citing O’Shea v. Twp. of West Milford (Passaic),
GRC Complaint No. 2007-237 (Interim Order dated May 28, 2008)). Specifically, the form
contained potentially misleading statements about the disclosability of personnel and police
investigation records. The Council thus ordered the Township to either amend the existing form
or adopt the GRC’s model request form. See also Wolosky v. City of Paterson (Passaic), GRC
Complaint No. 2011-134 (Interim Order dated August 28, 2012).</p>

<h3 id="personnel-records">Personnel Records</h3>

<p>Dusenberry v. NJ City Univ., GRC Complaint No. 2009-101 (April 28, 2010): The Council held
that the custodian lawfully denied access to outside activity questionnaires because they are
personnel records exempt from disclosure and because the University had an obligation to
safeguard from public access a citizen’s personal information. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-10; North Jersey
Media Group, Inc. v. Bergen Cnty. Prosecutor’s Office, 405 N.J. Super. 386 (App. Div. 2009).</p>

<p>Randazzo-Thompson v. City of Vineland (Cumberland), GRC Complaint No. 2010 - 76 (May
2011): The Council held that, “[t]here is no evidence in the record to indicate that the
Complainant herein knew of the right of confidentiality in her personnel file afforded pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 47:1A-10, and therefore no evidence that she knowingly waived that right when she
signed and submitted the OPRA request form. Accordingly, the Custodian properly denied
access to the contents of the Complainant’s personnel file pursuant to W. Jersey Title &amp; Guar.
Co. v. Indus. Trust Co., 27 N.J. 144, 152 (1958), Country Chevrolet, Inc. v. Twp. of N.
Brunswick Planning Bd., 190 N.J. Super. 376, 380 (App. Div. 1983), Paff v. Byrnes, 385 N.J.
Super. 574 (App. Div. 2006), and N.J.S.A. 47:1A-10.” Id. at 8.</p>

<p>Toscano v. NJ Dep’t of Human Serv., Div. of Mental Health Serv., GRC Complaint No. 2010-
147 (May 2011): The Council held that, “[t]he employment application sought by Complainant is
not disclosable pursuant to OPRA because it is a personnel record which is exempt from
disclosure pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-10, and Executive Order 26 (McGreevey 2002). See
N.J.S.A. 47:1A-9(a).” Id. at 6.</p>

<p>Lotito v. NJ Dep’t of Labor, Human Res., GRC Complaint No. 2013-65 (March 2014): The
Council held that PARS files are exempt from disclosure because they contain performance
evaluations. Cibo, Jr. v. Rowan Univ., GRC Complaint No. 2003-42 (February 2014); Baker v.
NJ Civil Service Comm’n, GRC Complaint No. 2009-253 (Interim Order dated July 27, 2010);

30, 2009).</p>

<p>Sciara v. Borough of Woodcliff Lake (Bergen), GRC Complaint No. 2011-32 (August 2012):
The Council first determined that the record at issue was a personnel record, regardless of the
complainant’s assertion that the record was not part of her personnel record. The Council next
held that the custodian lawfully denied access to the record on the basis that the complainant did
not knowingly waive the right confidentiality afforded to individuals when requesting their own</p>

<p>personnel records. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-10; McGee v. Twp. of East Amwell (Hunterdon), GRC
Complaint No. 2007-305 (March 2011).</p>

<h3 id="police-records">Police Records</h3>

<p>Gorman v. Gloucester City (Camden), GRC Complaint No. 2004-108 (Final Decision dated June
25, 2008): The Council conducted an in camera review of the requested mobile video recording
and also applied a balancing test to determine whether the custodian properly denied access to
same. The Council concluded that the recording did not constitute “inter-agency or intra-agency
advisory, consultative, or deliberative” material, but that the balancing test weighed in favor of
non-disclosure.</p>

<p>Morgano v. Essex Cnty. Prosecutor’s Office, GRC Complaint No. 2007-156 (Interim Order
dated February 27, 2008): The Council held that arrest reports are subject to disclosure with
redactions. The Council reasoned that “certain information with respect to a crime must be
disclosed pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-3(b)&hellip; The most comprehensive government record
containing information subject to disclosure pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-3(b) is the police arrest
report, alternatively referred to as a uniform arrest report&hellip; Arrest reports typically contain the
arrestee’s (defendant’s) name, age, residence, occupation, marital status, time and place of arrest,
text of the charges, arresting agency, identity of the arresting personnel, amount of bail and
whether it was posted. This is the same information that is mandated for disclosure pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 47:1A-3(b).” Id. at 11.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Shea v. Twp. of West Milford, 410 N.J. Super. 371 (App. Div. 2009): The Court affirmed the
trial court’s decision that use of force reports are not exempt as criminal investigatory records.
In reaching this conclusion, the Court determined that the “Attorney General’s Guidelines on the
Use of Force,” which required police departments to make use of force reports, carried the force
of law. Thus, the Court held that use of force reports could never meet the two-prong test
required to be exempt as criminal investigatory: that is, “‘not be required by law to be made,’
and the record must ‘pertain[] to any criminal investigation or related civil enforcement
proceeding.’” O’Shea, 410 N.J. Super. 371. But see Rivera v. Bergen Cnty. Prosecutor’s Office,
2012 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 2752 (August 8, 2012)(holding that names of suicidal or
emotionally disturbed individuals and those displaying other purported psychological conduct
that are not arrested may be redacted based on Executive Order No. 26 (Gov. McGreevey 2002)
and a balancing test).</p>

<p>Rivera v. City of Passaic (Passaic), GRC complaint No. 2011-214 (Interim Order dated July 31,
2012): The Council’s decision here touched on several types of police and personnel records,
including computer-aided dispatch (“CAD”) reports, daily duty logs, internal affairs
summary reports, use of forces reports, and vehicle pursuit records. The Council ordered
disclosure of CAD reports, internal affairs summary reports and use of force reports. However,
the Council determined that duty logs and vehicle pursuit records are exempt from access under
the security and surveillance exemption. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1.</p>

<p>Seabrooks v. Cnty. of Essex, GRC Complaint No. 2012-230 (Interim Order dated June 25,
2013): The Council held that arrest warrants are not exempt as criminal investigatory records
because they are required to be made pursuant to NJ Court Rules. R. 3:2-3(a).</p>

<p>Cheatham v. Borough of Fanwood Police Dep’t, GRC Complaint No. 2013- 262 (March 2014):
The Council determined that police incident reports are exempt as “criminal investigatory”

<h3 id="prepayment-of-copy-fees">Prepayment of Copy Fees</h3>

<p>Paff v. City of Plainfield, GRC Complaint No. 2006-54 (July 2006): The Council held that “[a]s
the custodian is awaiting payment for the duplication cost of the requested records, she is not
required to release said records until payment is received pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A- 5 (b)” See
also Reid v. NJ Dep’t of Corrections, GRC Complaint No. 2010-83 (Final Decision dated May

<h3 id="prevailing-party-attorney-s-fees">Prevailing Party Attorney’s Fees</h3>

<p>Teeters v. DYFS, 387 N.J. Super. 423 (App. Div. 2006): A complainant is a “prevailing party” if
he/she achieves the desired result because the complaint brought about a change (voluntary or
otherwise) in the custodian’s conduct. Attorney’s fees may be awarded when the requestor is
successful (or partially successful) via a judicial decree, a quasi-judicial determination, or a
settlement of the parties that indicates access was improperly denied and the requested records
are disclosed.</p>

<p>Mason v. City of Hoboken and City Clerk of the City of Hoboken, 196 N.J. 51 (2008): A
complainant is a “prevailing party” if he/she can demonstrate (1) “a factual causal nexus between
plaintiff’s litigation and the relief ultimately achieved”; and (2) “that the relief ultimately secured
by plaintiffs had a basis in law.”</p>

<p>Boggia v. Borough of Oakland, GRC Complaint No. 2005-36 (Interim Order dated October 28,
2005 ): The Council denied prevailing party attorney’s fees to the Complainant, who was an
attorney representing himself. The Council reasoned that “&hellip; the courts of the state have
determined that the state’s fee-shifting statutes are intended to compensate an attorney hired to
represent a plaintiff not an attorney who is the plaintiff representing himself.. .” (emphasis
added).</p>

<h3 id="privacy-concerns">Privacy Concerns</h3>

<p>Merino v. Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus, GRC Complaint No. 2003-110 (July 2004): The complainant sought access to “[c]opies of (1) all moving violations of Officer Michael Tuttle during career with Ho-Ho-Kus Police Department, (2) training records of Officer Tuttle; and (3) records of complaints or internal reprimands against Officer Tuttle.” After conducting a balancing test, the Council found that the home addresses should be redacted from the records provided to the complainant.</p>

<p>Perino v. Borough of Haddon Heights, GRC Complaint No. 2004-128 (November 2004): The
Complainant requested the name, address and phone number of a citizen who filed a noise
complaint with the Police Department. After conducting a balancing test, the Council held that
“[t]he Complainant’s stated need for access does not outweigh the citizen’s expectation of
privacy. In arriving at this conclusion, the potential harm of unsolicited contact and confrontation
between the citizen and the OPRA complainant and/or its agents or representatives was
considered. Therefore, the name, address and phone number of the citizen who brought the
complaint to the Borough’s attention should remain redacted from the requested documentation.”
Id.</p>

<p>Avin v. Borough of Oradell, GRC Complaint No. 2004- 176 (March 2005):^1 The complainant in
this case sought access to a “list of all homeowners who applied for a fire alarm or burglar alarm
permit in the last 3 years.” The Council balanced the severity of the security concerns of the
residents of the town against the public’s right of access under OPRA and held that the custodian
should not disclose the homeowners’ names and addresses.</p>

<p>Bernstein v. Borough of Allendale, GRC Complaint No. 2004- 195 (July 2005):^2 The
complainant in this case sought access to the names and addresses of dog license owners. The
Council conducted a balancing test and held that “pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 and Executive
Order 21 the records should not be disclosed because of the unsolicited contact, intrusion or
potential harm that may result.” Id.</p>

<p>Faulkner v. Rutgers Univ., GRC Complaint No. 2007-149 (May 2008): The complainant
requested names and addresses for Rutgers University football and basketball season ticket
holders for 2006. After conducting a balancing test, the Council held that “the Custodian did not
unlawfully deny the Complainant access to the requested season ticket holders’ lists pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1, which states that a public agency has a responsibility and an obligation to
safeguard from public access a citizen’s personal information with which it has been entrusted
when disclosure thereof would violate the citizen’s reasonable expectation of privacy.”</p>

<p>Paff v. Warren Cnty. Office of the Prosecutor, GRC Complaint No. 2007-167 (February 2008):
The complainant requested various records pertaining to State v. Philip Gentile,
Indictment/Accusation No. 07- 02 - 00060 - A. After conducting a balancing test, the Council held
that the name and address of the victim were properly redacted due to privacy concerns pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.</p>

<p>(^1) This is one complaint out of seven filed by this requestor to several municipalities regarding the same or similar
records.
(^2) This is one of six complaints filed by this requestor to several municipalities regarding the same or similar records.</p>

<p>Walsh v. Twp. of Middletown (Monmouth), GRC Complaint No. 2008-266 (Interim Order dated
January 26, 2010): The custodian redacted addresses from financial disclosure statements due to
privacy concerns. The Council stated that “[p]ursuant to the Local Government Ethics Law, all
financial disclosure statements filed are public records. N.J.S.A. 40A:9-22.6&copy;.” Id. at 6. As
such, the Council held that “[b]ased on the language of N.J.S.A. 40A:9-22.6(b), N.J.S.A. 40A:9-
22.6&copy; and the court’s note in Kenny v. Byrne, 144 N.J. Super. 243, 252 (App. Div. 1976), the
Custodian has unlawfully redacted addresses of real property owned by public officials.
Additionally, the Custodian has failed to bear her burden of proof that said redactions were
authorized by law. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-6.” Id. at 7. The Council ordered the custodian to release the
requested financial disclosure statements without redactions for real property owned.</p>

<p>Burnett v. Cnty. of Bergen, 198 N.J. 408 (2009): Without ambiguity, the court held that the
privacy provision “is neither a preface nor a preamble.” Rather, “the very language expressed in
the privacy clause reveals its substantive nature; it does not offer reasons why OPRA was
adopted, as preambles typically do; instead, it focuses on the law’s implementation.”
“Specifically, it imposes an obligation on public agencies to protect against disclosure of
personal information which would run contrary to reasonable privacy interests.” Id. at 423.</p>

<p>Atl. Cnty. SPCA v. City of Absecon, 2009 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 1370 (App. Div. 2009):
The Court conducted a balancing test and determined that the ASPCA’s need for access to the
requested dog licenses out-weighed the City’s need for confidentiality. A major factor in
reaching this conclusion was the ASPCA’s mission to investigate alleged animal abuse. See also
Renna v. Cnty. of Union, 2012 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 342 (February 17, 2012); Bolkin v.

<h3 id="public-agency">Public Agency</h3>

<p>Fair Share Housing Center, Inc. v. N.J. League of Municipalities, 207 N.J. 489 (2011): The
Supreme Court reviewed the Appellate Division’s decision that the New Jersey State League of
Municipalities (“League”) was not a public agency under OPRA. The Court acknowledged that
although the Appellate Division relied on the holding in The Times of Trenton Publ’g Corp. v.
Lafayette Yard Cmty. Dev. Corp., 368 N.J. Super. 425 (App. Div. 2004), it erred in “importing
into OPRA’s definition of ‘public agency’ the definition of a ‘public body’ found in [OPMA]&hellip;
[t]he language defining a ‘public body’&hellip; under OPRA are distinctly different.” The Court thus
held that a creation test, as opposed to a governmental function test, controlled in determining
whether an entity was a public agency for purposes of OPRA. Id. Specifically, the Court noted
that:</p>

<pre><code>In Lafayette Yard, we remained faithful to the text of [OPRA] and determined
that, in essence, the nonprofit corporation (an ‘instrumentality’) was created by a
public subdivision therefore making it a ‘public agency.’... The creation test, not
the governmental-function test, controlled. Our decision in this case, finding that
the [League] is a ‘public agency,’ is wholly consistent with... Lafayette Yard.
</code></pre>

<p>Id. at 507.</p>

<p>The Court thus reversed the Appellate Division’s decision and determined that the League was a
“public agency” subject to the provisions of OPRA.</p>

<p>Sussex Commons Ass’n, LLC v. Rutgers, the State Univ., 210 N.J. 531 (2012): The Supreme
Court held that Rutgers Law Clinic did not perform a government function and was not
controlled by either Rutgers or any other government agency. Thus, Rutgers Law Clinic was not
classified as a “public agency” and as not subject to OPRA.</p>

<p>Frey v. Delaware Valley Reg’l Planning Comm., GRC Complaint No. 2012- 139 (June 2013):
The Council determined that the Commission, which is a bi-state agency, is not subject to the
provision of OPRA. The Council reasoned that</p>

<pre><code>New Jersey courts have consistently determined that bi-state agencies are not
subject to a single-state’s jurisdiction. Furthermore, an analysis of the [Ballinger
v. Del. River Port Auth., 311 N.J. Super. 317, 324 (App. Div. 1998), aff’d , 172
N.J. 586 (2002)] factors does not lend itself to a determination that [the
Commission] should be subject to New Jersey law. First, the “Delaware Valley
Urban Area Compact” does not explicitly provide for unilateral state action.
Second, there is no complementary or parallel legislation since the definitions
contained in OPRA do not suggest any intent on the part of the Legislature to
extend its application to bi-state agencies. OPRA fails to reflect any intent to
exercise unilateral control over a bi-state agency’s procedures to provide public
access to its records. Had the Legislature intended for OPRA to apply to bi-state
agencies, it would have reflected this intent within the law. Del. River &amp; Bay
Auth. Finally, there is no indication that [the Commission] has impliedly
consented to be subject to New Jersey’s OPRA law.

<p>Id. at 3.</p>

<p>Paff v. N.J. State. Firemen’s Ass’n, 431 N.J. Super. 278 (App. Div. 2013): The Appellate
Division noted that, as discussed in League of Municipalities, OPRA lacks a “government-
function” test, but that “[w]hile proof of governmental function is not necessary to qualify an
entity as a public agency, the Court [in League of Municipalities] did not preclude the possibility
that such proof would be relevant and perhaps sufficient to qualify the entity.” Id. at 289. The
Court thus determined that the Firemen’s Association was a “public agency” under OPRA,
reasoning that it “owes its existence to state law, which authorized its creation, granted it powers,
including powers over local associations, and barred the creation of a competing state
association. The Court noted that the Association’s financial activities implicated OPRA’s aim to
shed light on the fiscal affairs of government because it received substantial tax revenues, it had
authority to assure those funds were properly spent, and it both disbursed funds and oversaw
such disbursement by local groups. The Court further reasoned that the Association served
numerous government functions in addition to the receipt and management of tax revenues,
including providing welfare benefits to a significant number of public servants and regulating the
activities of other corporate entities.</p>

<p>Paff v. Cmty. Educ. Ctr., 2013 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 2813 (App. Div. 2013): The Appellate
Division affirmed the Law Division’s decision that Community Education Center was not a
“public agency” for purposes of OPRA. Specifically, the Court agreed that Community
Education Center, an independent corporation operating in seventeen (17) states and Bermuda,
was neither created nor controlled by any government entity.</p>

<h3 id="records-previously-provided">Records Previously Provided</h3>

<p>Bart v. City of Paterson Hous. Auth., 403 N.J. Super. 609 (App. Div. 2008): The Appellate
Division reversed the Council’s decision that the custodian knowingly and willfully violated
OPRA (GRC Complaint No. 2005-145). The Court held that a complainant could not have been
denied access to a requested record if he already had in his possession at the time of the OPRA
request the document he sought pursuant to OPRA. Specifically, the Court noted that the
complainant had the record at issue in his possession, even going so far as to attach a copy of the
record to his Denial of Access Complaint. Further, the Court noted that requiring a custodian to
duplicate another copy of the requested record and send it to the complainant does not advance
the purpose of OPRA, which is to ensure an informed citizenry.</p>

<h3 id="records-provided-all">Records Provided, All</h3>

<p>Burns v. Borough of Collingswood, GRC Complaint No. 2005-68 (September 2005): The
custodian stated in the Statement of Information that one (1) record responsive to the
complainant’s March 2, 2005, OPRA request was provided and that no other records responsive
existed. The complainant contended that she believed more records responsive did, in fact, exist.
The GRC requested that the custodian certify as to whether all records responsive had been
provided to the complainant. The custodian subsequently certified on August 1, 2005 that the
record provided to the complainant was the only record responsive. The GRC held that the
custodian bore the burden of proving that she provided all responsive records that existed and
there was no competent, credible evidence on record to refute the certification. See also
Wadhams v. Town of Belvidere (Warren), GRC Complaint No. 2010-209 (October 2011);

<h3 id="redactions">Redactions</h3>

<p>Paff v. Borough of Manasquan (Monmouth), GRC Complaint No. 2009-281 (Interim Order
dated March 29, 2011): The Council held that, “[t]he method of ‘whiting out’ the executive
session portion of the minutes provided did not allow the Complainant to clearly identify the
specific location. Therefore, the Custodian’s method of ‘whiting out’ the requested minutes is
not “a visually obvious method that shows&hellip; the specific location of any redacted material in
the record” and is thus not appropriate under OPRA. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(g).” Id. at 8-9.</p>

<h3 id="ripeness">Ripeness</h3>

<p>Sallie v NJ Dep’t of Banking and Ins., GRC Complaint No. 2007-226 (April 2009): The
complainant forwarded a complaint to the GRC asserting that he had not received a response
from the custodian and seven (7) business days would have passed by the time the GRC received</p>

<p>the Denial of Access Complaint. The custodian argued in the Statement of Information that the
complainant filed the complaint prior to the expiration of the statutorily mandated seven (7)
business day time frame set forth in N.J.S.A. 47 :1A-5(i). The Council held that the complaint
was unripe for adjudication and dismissed same. See also Werner v. NJ Civil Serv. Comm’n.,
GRC Complaint No. 2011-151 (December 2012); Herron v. Borough of Red Bank (Monmouth),
GRC Complaint No. 2012-113 (April 2012).</p>

<h3 id="search-vs-research">Search vs. Research</h3>

<p>Donato v. Twp. of Union, GRC Complaint No. 2005 - 182 (February 2007): The Council held that
the custodian is obligated to search her files to find the identifiable government records listed in
the complainant’s OPRA request (auto accident reports for a certain period of time). The Council
further held, however, that the custodian is not required to research her files to figure out which
records, if any, might be responsive to a broad and unclear OPRA request in accordance with the
decision of MAG, and NJ Builders.</p>

<p>Verry v. Borough of South Bound Brook (Somerset), GRC Complaint No. 2013- 43 et seq.
(Interim Order dated September 24, 2013): The Council determined that a request seeking e-
mails without naming individuals was still valid. The Council stated that:</p>

<pre><code>[A] valid OPRA request requires a search, not research. An OPRA request is thus
only valid if the subject of the request can be readily identifiable based on the
request. Whether a subject can be readily identifiable will need to be made on a
case-by-case basis. When it comes to e-mails or documents stored on a computer,
a simple keyword search may be sufficient to identify any records that may be
responsive to a request. As to correspondence, a custodian may be required to
search an appropriate file relevant to the subject. In both cases, emails and
correspondence, a completed “subject” or “regarding” line may be sufficient to
determine whether the record relates to the described subject. Again, what will be
sufficient to determine a proper search will depend on how detailed the OPRA
request is, and will differ on a case-by-case basis. What a custodian is not
required to do, however, is to actually read through numerous e-mails and
correspondence to determine if same is responsive: in other words, conduct
research.

<h3 id="security-and-surveillance">Security and Surveillance</h3>

<p>Burton v. NJ Dep’t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, Div. of State Police, GRC Complaint No. 2010- 330
(May 201 1 ): The Council held that, “[t]he Custodian has lawfully denied access to the requested
payroll records because said records are exempt from public access under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-9(a).
which upholds exemptions contained in an Executive Order of the Governor, or any regulation
promulgated pursuant to an Executive Order of the Governor. Executive Order No. 47 (Christie
2010) permits rules proposed by the NJ Department of Law &amp; Public Safety to remain in full
effect. N.J.A.C. 13:1E- 3 - 2(a)3 exempts records which may reveal an agency’s surveillance,
security or investigative techniques or procedures and N.J.A.C. 13:1E-3.2(a)7 exempts ‘[t]he
duty assignment of an individual law enforcement officer or any personally identifiable
information that may reveal or lead to information that may reveal such duty assignment,
including, but not limited to, overtime data pertaining to an individual law enforcement officer.’
Despite payroll records being public records under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-10, the release of said records
in this instance leaves the Executive Protection Bureau vulnerable to how heavy of a security
level it places on protecting various dignitaries and are therefore exempt under the regulations
cited above.” Id. at 12-13.</p>

<p>Rivera v. City of Plainfield Police Dep’t (Union), GRC Complaint No. 2009-317 (May 2011):
The Council held that, “[b]ecause request Items No. 3 and 10 sought police daily duty logs,
which records necessarily include details regarding surveillance techniques and staffing levels
which, if disclosed, could pose a risk to the safety of police personnel as well as civilians
employed by the Plainfield Police Department, such records are exempt from the definition of a
government record pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1.”</p>

<h3 id="special-service-charge">Special Service Charge</h3>

<p>Fisher v. Dep’t of Law and Public Safety, Division of Law, GRC Complaint No. 2004- 55
(August 2006): The Council held that a special service charge is allowed under OPRA. N.J.S.A.
47:1A-5&copy;. The Council established a 14 factor criteria for evaluating (1) whether a special
service charge is warranted and (2) whether the amount is reasonable.</p>

<p>Courier Post v. Lenape Reg’l High Sch., 360 N.J. Super. 191 (Law Div. 2002): The Court found
that the request for six and one-half years of attorneys&rsquo; monthly itemized bills required an
extraordinary expenditure of time and effort to accommodate the request. Therefore, a special
service charge was allowed for the custodian&rsquo;s time.</p>

<h3 id="substantial-disruption">Substantial Disruption</h3>

<p>Caggiano v. NJ Dep’t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, Div. of Consumer Affairs, GRC Complaint No.
2007 - 69 (September 2007): The custodian certified that an extended review of records as
contemplated by the complainant (for approximately a week) would substantially disrupt agency
operations by requiring the extended attendance of a Division of Consumer Affairs employee
and a NJ State Police Officer at the complainant’s inspection of the requested records. The
Council stated that:</p>

<pre><code>“[t]he Custodian has reasonably offered to provide the Complainant with copies of
all the records responsive upon payment of the statutory copying rates, which the
Complainant has declined. The Custodian has also reasonably offered the
Complainant two (2) hours to inspect the seven hundred forty-five (745) pages
responsive to the Complainant’s request, of which the Custodian states a substantial
portion are records which the Complainant himself submitted to the Division.
Additionally, the Custodian has reasonably offered to accommodate the
Complainant’s request by charging a special service charge for the hourly rate of a
Division of Consumer Affairs employee to monitor the Complainant’s inspection
of the requested records in the event that said inspection exceeds two (2) hours.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Further, the Custodian has reasonably offered to copy the remaining records at the
OPRA copying costs in the event the Complainant exceeds a reasonable amount of
time for the record inspection, which the Custodian states is one (1) business day.
However, the Complainant objects to paying any inspection fees, as well as a two
(2) hour inspection time limit.”
</code></pre>

<p>The Council held that “because the Custodian has made numerous attempts to reasonably
accommodate the Complainant’s request but has been rejected by the Complainant, the
Custodian has not unlawfully denied access to the requested record under N.J.S.A. 47:1A- 5 &copy;
and N.J.S.A. 47:1A- 5 (g).” See also Vessio v. NJ Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs, Div. of Fire Safety,

<p>Caldwell v. Vineland Bd. of Educ. (Cumberland), GRC Complaint No. 2009-278 (March 2011):
The Council determined that the custodian could not deny access to a request as a substantial
disruption of agency operations without first attempting to reach a reasonable accommodation.
N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(g).</p>
