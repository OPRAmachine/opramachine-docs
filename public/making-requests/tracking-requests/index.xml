      <description>Our email alerts feature allows you to receive an email notification every time there is new activity related to the requests, public bodies or users that you follow on OPRAmachine. It is the simplest way to begin tracking OPRA requests. You can track requests made through the site without requiring you to publicly file requests under your real name, so if having your identity exposed is a concern preventing you from making a request, email alerts allow you to directly benefit from the information obtained by other people&amp;rsquo;s requests made on the OPRAmachine platform.</description>
