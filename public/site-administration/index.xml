      <description>To maximize the freedom of users to engage with our site, we moderate its content reactively. This means that we generally wait until an issue is brought to our attention to take action. Unless the user has continuously violated our policies after being given a warning, we are extremely hesitant to intervene, in the interest of allowing the users of our platform to freely express themselves. Members of the site administration team are expected to adhere to this principle.</description>
