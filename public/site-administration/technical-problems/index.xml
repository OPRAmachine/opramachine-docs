      <description>There continues to be problems with email delivery to a handful of municipalities. Their firewalls are improperly rejecting OPRAmachine correspondence. We need to investigate ways of approaching this issue and solving this problem proactively.
Spam Issues Identify towns where this is a problem
Amazon Issues We currently use Amazon SES to send outbound SMTP emails for OPRA requests sent via the site. We should investigate whether this is playing a role in deliverability and if alternatives may be warranted.</description>

      <description>The server that has been running the site has been crashing because of the high load due to user demand. We need to investigate ways to obtain better performance for the site or explore upgrades to the Linode instance.
Reasons for server crashes Since late October there have been a variety of reasons for server crashes at OPRAmachine.
Here are some of the reasons: - Lack of RAM - Database issues - Lack of disk space</description>
